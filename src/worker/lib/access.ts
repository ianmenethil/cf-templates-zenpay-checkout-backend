 * `ctx.access` when the runtime provides it, otherwise it verifies the Access token against the
 * team's public keys. Both must match `ACCESS_AUD`, and without `ACCESS_TEAM_DOMAIN` and
 * `ACCESS_AUD` every admin request is refused with `403`. Refusals answer `{ error }` JSON, like every other error;
 * the one for missing settings names none of them and logs which are missing.
 * Trailing slashes on `ACCESS_TEAM_DOMAIN` are ignored, so `https://team.cloudflareaccess.com/` works.
